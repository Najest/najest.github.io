              <h6>BY&nbsp;<a href="https://najest.github.io/" target="_blank">Najest Yang</a></h6>
              <p>Born in a mountain village, he lives all over China, and goes wherever the wind blows.</p><br>
              <p>You certainly don't know the wind as well as I do.</p><br>
              <p>When I see a windmill, I like to pick up my mobile phone and take a picture and send it to the circle of friends to show off, because this is my own work, there is a sense of achievement, so if you see the windmill anywhere, you can take a picture and share it with me, I will be very happy.</p><br>
              <p>I can accept any song, I like rock music the most, but I can't listen to all kinds of dirt hi songs, including but not limited to car DJs, middle-aged pop songs, and I feel that my ears are being raped.</p><br>
              <p>Like to drive around, road rage is more serious, will swear on brain-dead traffic behavior, with the car comes with a wrench, easy to get out of the car and confront people, smashed illegal parking, and has not had a fight with a driver without quality, has never suffered a loss, because of kindness I got out of danger.</p><br>

              <p>I especially enjoy the little bit of time I spend on all kinds of transport, because it's probably one of the few times of the day when I can use it to think and not waste it on my thoughts, and I don't feel guilty about the busy day, because you don't have much else to do on the road.</p><br>
              <p>I'm interested in the Internet, and I know a little bit of code, but I'm still a beginner, but I still have some proud web projects: for example, I built this website myself. I don't plan to continue studying Xi because I don't want to lose my hair, and I hope that my hair will still be dark and shiny when I get old.</p><br>
              <p>Now 29 years old, he has been to many cities in China, he has a strong ability to adapt to life, he is familiar with charlatans, and the railway station is really only the train. I still like to listen to rock music, but one day I will definitely not need it anymore. I'm good at a lot of weird things, I have two cats on a free-range basis, and I haven't figured out which city to buy the house in, and I haven't figured out which city to settle in, because I'm still wandering the world.</p><br>
